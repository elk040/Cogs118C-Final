Next Steps:

Correlation Analysis: Perform detailed correlation analysis between the different ECG channels (MLII, V5) to identify specific changes in heartbeats associated with arrhythmias.
Machine Learning: Build and train machine learning models (e.g., decision trees, random forests, SVM) to classify arrhythmias based on the extracted features and annotated data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate classifier performance using cross-validation and assess metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure the classifierâ€™s effectiveness.
