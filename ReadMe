Done So Far: 
Data preparation and cleaning: Processed ECG data from multiple channels (MLII and V5) and synchronized with annotation data (normal and arrhythmic beats),
aligned ECG signal data with annotated sample indices, preserving the types of heartbeats (e.g., 'N' for normal, 'A' for arrhythmic),
extracted ECG signal values at annotated sample indices for both MLII and V5 channels, 
and plotted ECG signals with overlaid annotations to visualize normal and arrhythmic beats for both channels.



Next Steps:

Correlation Analysis: Perform detailed correlation analysis between the different ECG channels (MLII, V5) to identify specific changes in heartbeats associated with arrhythmias.
Machine Learning: Build and train machine learning models (e.g., decision trees, random forests, SVM) to classify arrhythmias based on the extracted features and annotated data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate classifier performance using cross-validation and assess metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure the classifierâ€™s effectiveness.
